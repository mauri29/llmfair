                    <p>The European LL.M. Fairs 2017 are a joint venture between Lawbility (Switzerland; <a href="http://www.lawbility.com" target="_blank">www.lawbility.com</a>) and the German-American Lawyers’ Association DAJV (Germany; <a href="http://www.dajv.de/llm-fair.html" target="_blank">www.dajv.de/llm-fair.html</a>) with a long tradition and strong expertise in brining prospective LL.M. candidates and law schools together.</p>
                    <p>Year for year, ten to twenty US law schools, local law firms, and service providers travel to the European LL.M. Fairs and present themselves to prospective LL.M. candidates. Legal professionals and LL.M. candidates will get the great opportunity to meet them. This year, in addition to the fairs, to conferences and space for networking, we also provide the possibility for candidates to meet law school representatives and law firms in one-on- one interviews.</p>
